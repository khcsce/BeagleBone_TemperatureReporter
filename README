Content:
lab4b-105123806.tar.gz which contains:
lab4b.c ... source code for button and temperature sensor implementation on green beaglebone
README (this file)
Makefile

Makefile: 
default ... builds lab1a exec, 
clean ... deletes files created by the Makefile
dist ... builds a distribution tarball of files: lab1a.c, Makefile, READ, lab1a-105123806.tar.gz

Testing methodology:
Running ./lab4b with different options
typing STOP, START, SCALE=C, SCALE=F, OFF during the run to see if expected behavior are shown

"builds and runs on your embedded system.
uses the AIO functions of the MRAA library to get readings from your temperature sensor.
samples a temperature sensor at a configurable rate (defaulting to 1/second, and controlled by an optional --period=# command line parameter that specifies a sampling interval in seconds).
converts the sensor value into a temperature. By default, temperatures should be reported in degrees Fahrenheit, but this can be controlled with an optional --scale=C (or --scale=F) command line parameter.
creates a report for each sample that includes:
time of the sample (e.g. 17:25:58) in the local timezone
a single blank/space
a decimal temperature in degrees and tenths (e.g. 98.6)
a newline character (\n)
writes that report to the stdout (fd 1).
appends that report to a logfile (which it creates on your embedded system) if that logging has been enabled with an optional --log=filename parameter.
uses the GPIO functions of the MRAA library to samples the state of the button (from your Grove sensor kit) and when it is pushed ...
outputs (and logs) a final sample with the time and the string SHUTDOWN (instead of a temperature).
exits"
